MIDI Reader
===========

The code in this repository implements a simple MIDI reader in JavaScript.

To see it in action, open the file _MIDIReader.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  As of this writing, the program only parses the MIDI file into JSON and displays it.  The file can't be edited, and it can't be played.
